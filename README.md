# zzzlizzli
hey guys

the adult mother zzlizzli is the "first" zzlizzli, she is a immortal thing with inhuman features.
normal zzlizzli's can live up to 400 years
the mother is about 2975 years old having made the first zzlizzli's made in their image.
they're primarily green but their colors range from the regions where they reside
their names are often after tropical fruit or animals but this can vary on their regional differences.
the babies are bald yes bald because again they're birds, the "dress" flowy part on them is actually their tail that they fold around their legs to conceal their legs from the harsh climates (again this part can vary and alter based on regional development)
all zzlizzli's are female as they can asexually reproduce
they have the reproductive organs needed to reproduce normally but most if not all choose to do it without such
zzlizzli's colors and items they carry can vary depending on their regional area.

# "can i make my own zzlizzli?" 
yes!, remember the zzlizzli's have no color limits it just depends on where your zzlizzli are from!
think while making a zzlizzli where they reside and then base the colors on the area around them for example the green zzlizzli's are forest dwellers! they live in the trees.
